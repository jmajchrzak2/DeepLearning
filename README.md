First book: Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition

"A great way to learn something is to teach a course on it. So you are motivated to understand it."

Chris Bishop's second book: "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"

GPT4 out performs the specialist models. The general lesson, when you have a larger general model, it can outperform a specific model.

It's not a good use of GPT to multiple two numbers.

Large Language Models are good as an interface. "A copilot for the scientists."
